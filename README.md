# Yet another Go One-Time Password package

## Why?
Started from the need to use a OTP package, I found [this post](http://www.inanzzz.com/index.php/post/y5nu/creating-a-one-time-password-otp-library-for-two-factor-authentication-2fa-with-golang) and decided to build on top of it, and how to create a public go module and maintain it. 
A lot of failures, hiccups and what not is _sadly_ to be expected.
